No. Starch stored in chloroplasts, roots, underground stems, and seeds provide a supply of glucose for cellular activities such as plant growth.
It could increase the growth of food-bearing C3 plants that would otherwise produce energy inefficiently as a consequence of photorespiration. However, the changing ecosystem resulting from the release of greenhouse gases could prevent that from happening; increases in CO_2 also introduce additional environmental changes such as temperature differences. The consequence of these changes are too complicated to predict accurately.
Both reactions happen in chloroplasts, but in different parts of the organelle. The light reaction converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and the reduced electron carrier NADPH. But the light-independent reaction does not use light directly. The light-independent reaction usees ATP, NADPH, and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates. 
Noncyclic electron transport extracts electrons from water and pass them ultimately to NADPH, utilizing energy absorbed by photosystems I and II, and resulting in ATP synthesis. While cyclic electron transport is a cycle that begins and ends in photosystem I. Noncyclic electron transport yields NADPH, ATP, and oxygen; cyclic electron transport only yields ATP. 
It would probably absorb green-blue light because the red light is the first to get filtered out by the ocean. This would probably make the pigment in the organism look red to us, which is the reason we have red algae. 
Because photosynthesis actually creates ATP and/or sugars for mitochondra to metabolize, they could get all their energy from photosynthesis potentially. However, they would still need to eat to gain the amino acids and vitamins that they cannot synthesize themselves.
The thylakoid is the center for light-dependent reactions in photosynthesis, specifically photosystem 1 and 2, which produce NADPH and oxidize water molecules respectively.
Much like in mitochondria, plant cells use a form of chemiosmosis known as photophosphorylation in the chloroplast to facilitate the transport of protons and electrons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient across the membrane.  Protons are pumped from the stroma into the lumen and then forced back out by osmosis through protein channels in the thylakoid membrane, enabling ATP formation.
Each molecule is made up of a different amount of bonds, both to the total number of atoms and how many bonds each atom has to another atom (i.e. double and triple bonds.) The amount of energy in a photon must resonate with these bonds in a particular fashion in order for the electrons to bounce up to a higher energy level, and only certain wavelengths of light will emit the correct photons that will cause the bonds to vibrate and increase in energy.
C3 plants and C4 plants both use the Calvin cycle to obtain carbohydrates, but there are a lot of differences in the two types of plants. C3 plants use RuBP as the CO2 acceptor, and create 3 carbons chains as the first fixation product. C4 plants use PEP as the acceptor and create 4 carbon chains. Also, because of how the C4 plants are arranged inside the leaf, and that they use both mesophyll and the bundle sheath as photosynthetic cells, their amount of photorespiration is low and therefore can keep their stomas open in environments that extract water from the leaves. C3 plants have a large amount of photorespiration in these times and therefore close their stomas in the event of a likelihood of losing water, which is why they are not able to continue to use CO2 and have to begin to use O2.
carbon dioxide + water => sugar + oxygen                                                                            6Co2 + 6H2O => C6H12O6 +6O2
using oxygen isotopes (16O and 18O) he was able to prove that the Oxygen that was used to form oxygen gas in photosynethsis came from the water and not the carbon dioxide
The Calvin Cycle's enzymes are only activated during the times when they are exposed to sunlight, keeping the cell from attempting photosynthesis in the dark.
By absorbing both red and blue light, the action spectrum of photosynthesis is expanded to cover green and yellow light. 
More ATP than NADPH is needed for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.
Rubisco prefers to catalyze reactions between RuBP and CO2, but if there is a lot more O2 than CO2 around then rubisco will catalyze reactions between RuBP and O2, forming phosphoglycolate.  75 percent of the carbon from phsophoglycolate can be recycled via a lengthy process into the Calvin cycle but carbon is still lost. 
Because light-independent reactions of photosynthesis require more ATP, if only the non cyclic pathway is operating, there is a chance that not enough ATP will be formed. The cyclic electron transport makes up for the imbalance.
Energy losses in photosynthesis is due to wavelengths not part of the absorption spectrum of photosynthetic pigments (50%), light energy not absorbed due to plant structure (30%), inefficiency of light reactions converting light to chemical energy (10%), and inefficiency of carbon dioxide fixation pathways (5%). C4 plants adapt to inefficiencies when using rubisco by increasing CO2 to rubisco in the bundle sheath cells in the interior of the leaf. CAM plants adapt similarly to the C4, except the initial CO2 fixation is temporally separated from the Calvin cycle. This loss of energy is important because as we face an uncertain future for photosynthesis, understanding efficiencies becomes more important. If biologists could improve the basic biology of photosynthesis, they could make a more efficient use of energy and have a better food production.
 There are two photosystems in the Z scheme because the cell needs to take the electron from a higher energy to a lower energy level. When the photon hits the photosystem 680 an electron is released with a high energy state. Through a serious of reactions, the electron is pulled down to a lower energy state, thus creating energy for the cell. This electron is then used again in a lower energy Photosystem (700). After it is excited to this level, the electron is taken by the NADH and removed from the process.
When one is looking at the color given off by plants, one is actually seeing the wavelengths of light not being used. In the case of the blue plants, the chloroplasts are tuned to use lower energy light, mainly green to red. 
Two photosystems are required because one produces ATP but not NADPH. The first photosystem creates an ATP and sends the electron that gave its energy for ATP synthesis. The second then re-excites the electron via absorption of photon and creates NADPH.
About 95% of the energy from the sunlight is lost during photosynthesis. There are several reasons for the loss, including the inability of chlorophyll to absorb certain wavelengths of light and the inefficiency of the chemical reactions inside the chloroplast.
Both plants and animals use ATP synthase to produce ATP from a proton gradient, a process called chemiosmosis. The ATP synthase in plants and animals is very similar and is unlikely to have arisen independently in two evolutionary branches by chance. Therefore, the use of ATP synthase in biochemical pathways must be at least as old as the separation between the plant and animal evolutionary branches (more than a billion years ago).
There are two different ways in which plants fix carbon dioxide, C3 and C4 plants, describing whether the initial product of carbon dioxide fixation is a 3 or 4 carbon molecule. C4 plants have an evolutionary advantage over C3 plants in conditions which favor photorespiration. But because C4 plants expend an ATP molecule in the fixation process, C4 plants are disadvantaged under moderate temperature conditions with high levels of carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, it is unknown how climate change will affect global crop portfolios, which consist of both C3 and C4 plants. While increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will be advantageous for C3 plants, possible increased temperature would be advantageous for C4 plants. For this reason, it is unclear on a global scale how climate change will affect growth rates of C3 and C4 plants. However, it is very possible that local changes in crop production will be necessary.
The lawn will likely be taken over by the Bermuda grass. C4 plants have evolved mechanisms to function well under conditions of high temperature but C3 plants partially close their stroma under high heat to lower water loss and by doing so reduce their rate of photosynthesis. Because of this, the Bermuda grass will likely outgrow the Kentucky bluegrass.
Lower plants tend to be shaded by higher plants and thus have a limited supply of sunlight. Given this, any mechanism that allows a specific lower plant to maximize this precious resource and obtain the most energy from it is an advantage over other lower plants. Lower plants that had mutations that allowed them to synthesize accessory pigments would have been the fittest lower plants at their time. By being able to photosynthesize more and reproduce more offspring, these lower plants passed down their genetic information more frequently than other lower plants, thereby ensuring that most lower plants today can synthesize accessory pigments.
In temperate zones, C3 plants would normally have an advantage over C4 plants because they don't have to use extra ATP to surround rubisco (O2 or CO2 acceptor molecule), but in the tropics where the temperature is high and photorespiration is favored, C4 plants thrive. C4 plants thrive over CAM plants in the tropics because C4 plants, in wetter conditions, are more efficient at metabolizing. In the desert, however, where conditions are dry, CAM plants are favored because they close their stomata during the day, preventing loss of water, unlike the C4 plants which only partially close their stomata.
Grow the plants in a Greenhouse of a controlled environment so that water and CO2 loss is minimized. Genetically modify plants so that they can absorb all wavelengths of sunlight. Genetically modify plants so that they can turn their leaves toward or away from sunlight based on how much light they need (there's a plant that actually does this called the desert ironwood).
The dual membrane surrounding chloroplasts with the inter membrane space used as a Hydrogen ion repository for later electron transport use implies that chloroplasts were initially phagocytosized whole and given the second membrane by a the formation of an ineffective lysosome. Chloroplasts also have their own DNA, implying they were initially their own self-reproducing organism.
Cyclic phosphorylation, centered on photosystem 1, takes in energy by capturing a photon which elevates an electron to a higher energy level, causing it to enter the protein electron transport chain and force Hydrogen ions across a membrane. These Hydrogen ions then fall back down their electrical and solute potential curves and transfer through ATP synthase, producing ATP. This process only produces ATP rather than the energy storing NADPH.
It is necessary because going from CO2 and H2O to glucose and O2 requires a large amount of chemical energy (in the form of ATP). The cells cannot produce/store large amounts of ATP at once. A cyclic reaction requires only small amounts of ATP to be produced/stored at a given time.
In a hot, dry climate, the stomata of plants close to prevent water from evaporating. However, this also closes off the plant cells' CO2 source. With a lack of CO2 being fed to the rubisco enzymes, the rubisco enzymes act as oxygenases instead - increasing the rate of photorespiration.
Accessory pigments allow some photosynthetic organisms -- such as cyanobacteria and algae -- to harness wavelengths of light for energy that they couldn't with just chlorophyll. The energy from harvesting these extra wavelengths can then be transferred to chlorophyll for ATP synthesis. However, if some of these accessory pigments absorb light at wavelengths that overlap with the wavelengths chlorophyll absorbs, then the organism may generate energy less efficiently than if it just had chlorophyll as its pigment.
The cells in the plant root grow and stay alive by cellular respiration. The sugars for the respiration come from plant cells on the surface, which will transport polysaccharides or starches generated by the Calvin Cycle down to the root.
On a hot day, the leaves of a C3 plant will conserve water by closing their stomata.  Because of the higher O2 concentration, rubisco will act as both an oxygenase and a carboxylase, and photorespiration will occur.  Similarly, a C4 plant will partially close its stomata.  However, and enzyme known as PEP carboxylase which is present in mesophyll cells fixes CO2 even at low CO2 levels.  Its purpose is to create bundle sheath cells which concentrate CO2 around rubisco, “pumping” it up so that it will continue to act as a carboxylase.   
Light energy is essential to the process of photosynthesis. In the light reactions, light energy is converted to chemical energy (in the form of ATP and NADPH) which is used in the dark reactions to reduce CO2 to produce carbohydrate.  
The first outcome is that the photon would bounce off of the molecule, which would mean it is either scattered or reflected. In this case, there is no change in the energy of the molecule. The second outcome is that the photon could be transmitted, or passed through the molecule, which also causes no change in the energy of the molecule. The third option is that the molecule absorbs the photon. In this case the energy from the photon is absorbed by the molecule causing the molecule to raise to an excited state.  
The process of fluorescence is when absorbed energy is given off as heat and light. Since energy is being given off, the released photon leaves with a longer wavelength and less energy than the absorbed photon. 
Unlike most plants, red algae has accessory pigments that help during photosynthesis. Instead of just absorbing red and blue light, red algae uses phycobilins to convert the whole spectrum into energy
Changes in pH (caused by light energy) activates Calvin cycle enzymes. Also, electron transport caused by light reduces disulfide bonds in the Calvin cycle enzymes. This leads to a change in their shape, which activates them and increases the rate of the Calvin cycle.
Corn, as a C3 plant, has a competitive advantage over C4 plants because it doesn’t expend extra energy to increase the CO2 concentration around rubisco to ensure the carboxylase function is favored. However, C4 plants’ initial CO2 fixation works well at low carbon levels and high temperatures and prevents C4 plants from losing carbons to photorespiration. So at high temperatures (e.g., in tropical climates), C4 plants do better.
A CAM plant would probably be best under these conditions. C4 plants are more effective than C3 plants in high-temperature situations, and CAM plants have a similar photosynthesis process to C4 plants, but with a temporal (rather than spatial) separation of CO2 fixation and the Calvin cycle that allows the plant to minimize water loss (by only having its stomata open at night).
A single reaction would be so exergonic that no single endergonic metabolic reaction would be able to harvest the energy. The excess energy would remain unused and could cause problems when released as heat.
The metabolic pathways in diabetes patients are not regulated properly.
Both processes begin with glycolysis; however, lactic acid fermentation uses the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase to produce 2 lactic acid molecules and 2 ATP free energy, while alcoholic fermentation uses the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase to produce 2 ethanol molecules, 2 carbon dioxide, and 2 ATP free energy. 
In one experiment, mitochondria without a food source were "fooled" into making ATP by raising the H+ concentration in their environment. This demonstrated that a proton (H+) gradient across a membrane can drive ATP synthesis. In another experiment, a light-driven proton pump isolated from bacteria was inserted into artificial lipid vesicles. This experiment proved that the enzyme ATP synthase is the catalyst for chemiosmosis.
Oxygen is very electronegative and readily accepts spare electrons from the processes of cellular respiration.
While runners can quickly exhaust their supply of free glycogen, their secondary source of energy is fats. Fats burn for more energy than carbohydrates and are a superior fuel in that respect, but burn only when there is no carbohydrate. This second wind is what the runner feels when she switches from burning carbohydrates to burning fats.
We know osmosis to be the movement of a solute from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration.  Since proton pumping creates a large concentration of H+ ions within the intermembrane space, it is artificially creating that higher concentration and can harness the desire for balance in chemiosmosis.
Polysaccharides, lipids and proteins can be broken down to produce pyruvate in glycolysis.  This allows macro-molecules to come from the results of Pyruvate Oxidation and the Citric Acid Cycle for recycled use in energy production.  The Citric Acid cycle is also capable of utilizing some amino acids allowing it to cycle forwards and backwards in their production.
The body recycles NADH for several reasons – one, NADH is a rather larger ring that would require active transport out of the cell in order to be passed out of the body. Another reason is that when the molecule is oxidized and the proton H+ is taken off, there is an electron that is taken off also and placed into a system that helps create ATP, and eventually this system creates water. If this molecule just left the cell and was not used to further create ATP, then part of the energy stored in the original glucose molecule will not have been used. Another reason is that the molecule is so large that it would be difficult to re-synthesize, and so it would cost significantly more in energy to make than in what it would help to produce.
Allosteric regulation is the regulation of an enzyme by some type of molecule that binds to the enzyme and either inhibits the creation of a molecule or activates the building of a molecule. An example of this can be found in the citric acid cycle, in isocitrate dehydrogenase. When this enzyme comes into contact with ATP and NADH, it is inhibited and does not convert isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate. If it comes into contact with NAD+ and ADP, it is activated and works even faster to complete this conversion. It is important because it helps regulate the levels of certain molecules within your body, for example, glucose. If there was no allosteric regulation, then glucose levels would skyrocket, and water in the cells would leave because of the hypertonic solution. The cells would then deflate and crinkle, and not be able to function as well, because their solvent is gone.
Respiration requires oxygen but generates more ATP
Net gain 2 ATP molecules.  The first 5 steps require energy
It would be critical to incude high levels of starch and protiens, as well as significant lipids. The starch would allow the brain to not require protein to be sacrificed. The protien would help to rebuild damage, and the lipids would begin to rebuild the individual's stores of biological energy.
Arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, which effectively stops the majority of energy being harvested from glucose. This also explained why it works so quickly, as the body simply can not function without ATP.
glycolysis uses phosphofructokinase, which is is allosterically inhibited by ATP or citrate and activated by ADP or AMP.  so if too much glucose is being broken down there is a lot of ATP which will inhibit glycolysis.  the citric acid cycle uses the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase, which has the feedback inhibitors NADH and ATP.  ADP and NAD+ are activators.  so if the body is getting enough ATP, then the citric acid cycle (which is part of producing ATP) slows down.  if the citric acid cycle slows way down, citrate can build up, which activates synthase for fatty acids, so the body produces fat to store the excess energy.
If the citric acid cycle slows way down, citrate can build up, which activates synthase for fatty acids, so the body produces fat to store the excess energy.
Pyruvate is turned into lactic acid in lactic acid fermentation to preserve the electron carrier when there is no oxygen present. Also, in the absence of oxygen, a small amount of ATP can be produced by glycolysis and fermentation. It regenerates NAD+, which allows ATP formation to continue.
The chemiosmotic  mechanism is the transfer of electrons along proteins embedded in the membrane. The potential energy of the H+ gradient  is harnessed by ATP synthase. There are two experiments the book offers to demonstrate this (pg. 180): (1.) Mitochondria are isolated from cells and placed in a medium at pH 9 which results in a low H+ concentration on both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondria are moved quickly to a neutral medium (pH = 7; Higher H+ concentration). This raises the H+ concentration in the inter-membrane space and creates an H+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. H+ movement into the matrix drives the synthesis of ATP in the absence of continuous electron transport. The artificial H+ gradient  is sufficient for ATP synthesis by mitochondria. (2.) A proton pump extracted from bacterium is added to an artificial lipid vesicle. H+ is pumped into the vesicle creating a gradient, but no ATP is made. ATP synthase from a mammal is inserted in the vesicle membrane. The hydrogen diffuses out the vesicle and ATP is synthesized, demonstrating that ATP synthase is necessary for ATP synthesis.
In the electric transport chain, multiple steps are needed in order to get the protons out of the cell. By taking multiple steps, the proton gradient is achieved.
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The proteins involved come from the nucleus. The citric cycle and the electron transport chain occur in the mitochondria. Their genes are dictated by the mtDNA. As a result, there can be a mix match between the proteins, and errors can occur.
In the anaerobic process, aka fermentation, the free energy is released as lactic acid or ethanol. In cellular respiration, the aerobic process, the energy is released as heat. (used as activation energy for other reactions that occur in the body)
One of the waste products of fermentation is ethanol. Ethanol is the aspect that provides the alcoholic characteristics.
The human body uses a certain amount of energy each day on average. Ideally, the energy input to our bodies should be equivalent to our usage. We could estimate this energy requirement from the recommended daily calorie intake (2000 kcal). Next, we need to know how much energy a molecule of ATP stores (12 kcal/mole). We can assume that all calories taken into the system are converted into ATP. Now, if we know the density of ATP (507.8 g/mole), we can calculate an estimate for the amount of ATP synthesized by our bodies each day: ~85 kg. This estimate is an overestimate, as some energy from metabolic processes is lost (not all of it is used to convert ADP to ATP). The digestion of food into molecules able to enter the metabolic pathway (which can then be used to produce ATP) also requires energy. According to Wikipedia, energy conversion from food to ATP is about 40% efficient, giving us approximately 34 kg of ATP synthesized daily (75 pounds).
The metabolic pathway is highly interconnected and able to convert between various molecules as necessary. Carbohydrates enter the metabolic pathway as glucose in glycolysis. The end result of glycolysis is pyruvate, which exits pyruvate oxidation as acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA enters the citric acid cycle. One of the intermediates of the citric acid cycle, citric acid, activates an enzyme called fatty acid synthase, which converts excess acetyl CoA to fatty acids. Fats can then be made from a combination of fatty acids and glycerol. Therefore, the body can store excess carbohydrates (glucose intake) as fats.
Without a way to control how much uncoupling happens, the heat energy might send the body into fevers so high that it is fatal.
Anaerobic respiration yields a net gain of 2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose lysed; aerobic respiration yields a net gain of 32 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose lysed. This means that organisms that can respire aerobically are much more energy efficient than organisms that cannot. This energy efficiency allows the organism to support more functions and a higher rate of growth, resulting in a larger size compared to organisms that can only respire anaerobically.
It would be important to put the cabbage and other Kimchi ingredients in an air tight jar so that the bacteria with anaerobic metabolism can ferment the cabbage (and prevent competition from microorganisms with aerobic metabolism)
The fat man would. He has a higher fat to muscle ratio and fat has a higher efficiency in storing energy due to its long chains. Long chains usually mean more stored energy.
Lactic acid fermentation allows the cell to effectively recycle the NADH electron carriers which it uses in the process of glycolysis. In an aerobic environment where the cell has no sources of oxygen, it cannot perform aerobic respiration and has to use glycolysis repetitively which quickly uses up all the NAD+ molecules in the cell, so fermentation is used to reconvert the NADH produced back into NAD+ and allow energy production to continue.
Cellular respiration utilizes an electron transport chain made up of proteins on the surface of mitochondrion’s inner membrane which passes hydrogen across lower and lower energy level reactions which each move a Hydrogen ion into the inter membrane space, transferring chemical potential energy to electrical and solute potential energy. The final step of the electron transport chain allows the hydrogen ions to “fall” back down the potential energy curve, producing kinetic energy which is created in the process of releasing their electrical and solute potential energy back into chemical energy in the form of ATP. This process conserves the energy involved in its transfers between different forms of energy and leaves less “waste” through this gradual process than just jumping from the NADH molecule to the end result of H2O.
Electron transport causes electrons in the cells to travel through proteins in the membrane of the mitochondria. Attracted to these electrons, protons move to and out of the membrane. However, the outside of the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons, so these protons remain outside of the mitochondria, creating a gradient.
High levels of ATP will cause cells to shut down the citric acid cycle, because more energy is not required. Acetyl CoA, normally used in the citric acid cycle, would be diverted to anabolic processes that would use these molecules in the buildup of fatty acids in cells.
Lactic acid is a byproduct of fermentation. This indicates that the build up occurs due to the cells not receiving enough oxygen from the blood. The lack of oxygen forces the cells to resort to fermentation to create ATP, instead of cellular respiration.
This way, the cell doesn't consume excess amounts of glucose, and therefore doesn't produce more ATP than it uses.
The presence of oxygen affects the combinations of metabolic pathways which are used in the energy-harvesting process.   In the presence of oxygen, cellular respiration, which produces CO2 and H20 through the complete breakdown of glucose, occurs.  When oxygen is not present, fermentation, which produces lactic acid or ethanol and CO2 through incomplete oxidation, occurs.  Because it traps energy through complete oxidation, cellular respiration produces more energy than fermentation.
Redox reactions involve the simultaneous processes of reduction and oxidation.  In a redox reaction, one chemical, the reducing agent, loses electrons (oxidation) which are transferred to another chemical, the oxidizing agent. 
The aerobic process is called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration takes place when there is oxygen present in the environment.  There is a complete oxidation reaction, which means that the pyruvate becomes the waste products water and carbon dioxide. Some of the energy stored in the covalent bonds of the pyruvate is captured to form ATP (about 32 ATP molecules per glucose molecule). The anaerobic process is called fermentation. Fermentation takes place in oxygen free environments. Fermentation breaks down the pyruvate into lactic acid or ethanol, which is not a complete oxidation, so much less energy is released (about 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule). 
Because it acts by inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase, it causes a decrease in the production of acetyl CoA. Because not as much acetyl CoA is being produced, it causes the citric acid cycle and other dependent reactions to stop. Because these processes stop, ATP stops being produced, which means that the cells run out of ATP. When the cells run out of ATP, they can’t perform essential processes that are powered by ATP and so the cells die. 
When oxygen is present, the cell can employ cell respiration, which yields roughly 15 times more ATP. It does this by using O2 as an electron acceptor, allowing the cooperation of 4 different pathways to produce ATP.
NADH and NAD+ are coenzymes that facilitate redox reactions. NADH is reduced, and NAD+ is oxidized. NADH can package energy, whereas NAD+ is an electron carrier.
A one-step reaction would release too much energy at once; there would be no way to harvest the energy efficiently for later use. Having multiple steps in the pathway makes the release of energy more controlled and enables the released energy to be harvested.
Bread is primarily polysaccharides (starch). These will be hydrolyzed to glucose. Glucose passes through glycolysis and cellular respiration (pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and the respiratory chain/ATP synthesis). The energy is captured in the resulting ATP.
In cases of severe malnutrition and starvation, the body will begin breaking down its own proteins in order to produce glucose for energy. Plumpy'nut contains a high density of proteins in order to facilitate repairing the broken down muscles and digestive tissue. Since carbohydrates will generally immediately be converted to energy, in order to promote weight gain, Plumpy'nut contains a large amount of fats, which will be stored in the body's adipose tissue,
A vast majority of ATP is produced by phophorylation aided by hydrogen ions flowing through ATP synthase. In order for this reaction to favor ATP, a concentration gradient must be maintained between either side of mitochondria's inner membrane. The transmembrane space will contain a higher concentration of hydrogen ions and thus will have a lower pH than the mitochondrial matrix.
Patentability serves as an incentive for corporations to fund groundbreaking biotechnology research that could help to save lives and protect the environment. On the other hand, since patents last for 20 years, patented organisms could slow the advancement of science, limiting investigations based on the original work. Additionally, the patent holder could restrict access to life-saving treatments involving patented microorganisms.
Knockout experiments could be used to deactivate genes in existing organisms with desirable traits in order to identify the genes responsible for those traits. Once the genes have been identified, they can be introduced into plants lacking those traits.
Recombinant DNA is a DNA molecule made int he laboratory that is derived from at least two genetic sources. First different restriction enzymes are added to the DNA sample, which recognize palindromic DNA sequences. These enzymes then cut the DNA straight through the middle of the palindrome. DNA ligase then combines the fragments by forming covalent bonds.
Both methods are used in selective breeding. However modern recombinant DNA technology has several advantages over traditional methods of breeding: ability to identify specific genes, ability to introduce any gene from any organism into a plant or animal species, and ability to generate new organisms quickly. Traditional methods of breeding is more of a hit-or-miss affair.  
Nope. The genes in the viruses that cause degradation of the cell and its function are removed and replaced with other genes that are inserted into the host cell DNA. These are also equipped with the correct primers to be transcribed with the host DNA.
If crops are engineered to be herbicide resistant, the use of herbicides would have to accompany the crops to utilize the changes. This makes the use of herbicides more widespread and allows for the weeds around the crops to develop immunity even through natural selection (much like how bacteria can become immune to antibiotics). This happens without directly passing immunity genes between the crops and the weeds.
Our ability to produce artificial mutations allows us to simulate natural selection, which in turn allows us to experimentally produce organisms with favorable traits.  While this in itself is not random, natural selection or evolution through adaptation, with the right experimental procedures it can be.
The synthesized bacteria in this first experiment was made form a copied genome, so its behavior can be expected to a point.  However, as scientists begin to synthesize completely novel genomes, they have no notion of how a new organism could impact the environment it is introduced to.  Just as introducing non-native species often upsets the local ecosystem, introducing a synthesized species, even if it were engineered for a purpose, could completely destabilize the environment, as not only would it not be native to its local environment, it is completely alien to the natural world in general.
Some advantages to having genetically modified crops are that they are more likely to withstand conditions that other crops cannot. For example, they can be modified to contain a toxin, which will kill herbivorous insects that could possibly kill the plants. They also can be modified to grow in environments that the plant cannot normally tolerate, such as extremely salty soil. Some disadvantages are that these modifications can be passed on to weeds, and then those plants will become more commonplace because they will be harder to get rid of. Also, a lot of people are very wary towards modified plants because they think that they are unhealthy.
In order to make the experiment more efficient, I would provide a better medium for transgenic operations. Plasmids are fairly common, but they require a much larger amount of fragments (700,000 versus 160,000 in viruses), so I would try to run the experiment using viruses rather than using plasmids. I would also try to create cDNA or siRNA to make the fragments of RNA unable to work. And to be able to tell if the gene was transferred before the mouse is born, you can place a reporter gene into the plasmid or virus, such as GFP, that helps create glowing proteins that you can recognize.
Recombinant DNA is a DNA molecules made in a lab that is derived from at least two distinct genetic sources. Recombinant DNA is made by using restriction enzymes to cut fragments of DNA and combine them using DNA Ligase.
through chemica/elecrical treatment, viral vectors, or injections
No, I do not believe Pharming to be ethical, as we, (humans,) are effectively using other mammalians as pitri dishes because we, (again as a species,) are too cheap to do otherwise. This having been said, I would still believe Pharming to be an fundamentally incorrect, yet unavoidable practice, as it has the potential to vastly increase the quality of life for disadvantaged members of a society who can not afford 30,000 dollars a year in medicine. 
I believe that individuals not closely involved with the process or those who stand to gain by it invest serious time, money, and brainpower into what the long-term effects might be, and how they can be minimized though policy, adaptation of the GMO, or other precauthionarry measures. This, of course, can provide no certainty, but can at least try to lessen the odds of calamity. 
For example, to create enough of a protein to help with this one disease that results in being really short and having other problems, the amino acid sequence is known.  So scientists inserted the sequence to code for this in the same section of DNA that cows use to code for milk proteins, so the cow's milk now contains this protein.  The protein is harvested from the milk.  There are numerous other examples in this chapter, and there are also outlined reasons against GMO.
Not all cells that are exposed to the new DNA will take it in.  In fact, only about 1 in 10,000 by some methods.  So, the cells that do successfully become recombinant have to be harvested from the rest of the cells.  The reporter gene makes it easy to distinguish recombinant from unchanged cells.  One common recombinant gene creates a phenotype that makes recombinant cells resistant to an antibiotic, so the unchanged cells all get killed off and the recombinant cells survive.
A goal of recombinant DNA is to clone genes for analysis. It is also used to make transgenic cells. It is used in biotechnology in the production of protein factories. There was an example from the book about TPA harvested in E. coli in large amounts in order to dissolve blood clots in stroke patients Recombinant DNA is used in the production of GMO's (which can be a positive or a negative depending on your outlook on GMO's). Natural crops are often better able to adapt to surroundings while the genetically mutated crops need to be carefully maintained. Some public concerns about biotechnology: (1) Genetic manipulation is an unnatural interference with nature; (2) genetically altered foods are unsafe to eat; (3) genetically altered crop plants are dangerous to the environment.
The book gives the example with TPA to treat stroke patients that suffer from blood clotting. mRNA for TPA is reverse transcribed to get cDNA for TPA. This is then inserted in an expression vector for E.coli and E. coli is transformed with this vector. TPA is produced by E. coli, harvested, purified and injected into a stroke patient to dissolve the blood clots. Other examples include pharming and bioremediation.
In computational coding, it is often necessary to print values of code in order to see if the program is working as expected. The same is true when biologists place recombinant DNA into a host cell. They need some visual cue in order to prove or disprove that the appropriate gene is being replicated. Both methods allow the scientist to validate their experiment/code.
Round Up Ready cotton is a genetically modified crop that is resistant to the herbicide effects of Round Up. Monsanto most likely found a plant gene that was resistant to the effects of Round Up and placed this gene into the common Soybean. As a business model, this is very smart because not only does Monsanto sell the farmer the seed, but they also sell the herbicide which the seed is resistant to. 
Eurkaryotic hosts are better than prokaryotic hosts for creating recombinant DNA for humans because prokaryotes are not good representatives for eukaryotic DNA.
By cloning, people can have preference over which genes they want that are not naturally found. There can be unpredictable consequences due to this process. (They can accelerate the processes by which natural selection occurs)
The extra energy the GM bacteria must expend expressing the transgene and replicating the plasmids is not providing the GM bacteria with a survival advantage against its wild-type brethren (and other microorganisms). As the GM bacteria are less fit than the wild-type bacteria, it is unlikely that the GM bacteria will survive given competition for resources.
The study of mRNA is a proxy for studying proteins. Proteins are the end results of cellular expression. The study of proteins (proteomics) can directly reveal interactions between polypeptide chains and post-translational modification that occurs after translation from mRNA.
Because the process of making recombinant DNA is not perfect and because only a very small proportion of cells exposed to appropriate vectors take up the recombinant vector, it is important to be able to separate the cells that are genetically-modified from those that are not.
Weeds and other organisms that the herbicide is supposed to kill might develop resistance to the herbicide if the genes were somehow transferred from the plants to them. This may result in the outcropping of superweeds that are much tougher to kill.
We are aware that DNA is responsible for storing our genetic data, but what about other forms of data? Since we are working with ACGT instead of 1s and 0s, it is possible to more densely store greater amount of information compared to the forms of data storage we have today.
Scientists often mutate influenza to a more viral version in order to create a vaccine for the more viral version. They argue that this would be more effective against the current versions of influenza. One of the consequences associated with this is, if some of these mutated influenza manage to escape the confines of the laboratory, there may be an epidemic on our hands.
Genetically modified food has new qualities which are more desirable in either it’s production or consumption. The main effects of these tweaks are hardier, more pest resistant, tastier and more fruitful plants, but we don’t know what other, subtler, longer term effects may arise from these modifications. It may turn out that GMO food isn’t as healthy as the “natural” variety or that becoming more pest resistant kills off a pest and allows a worse one to spread. The threat of a loss in bio-diversity is always present; reducing the number of possible genetic combinations is likely to make the species less hardy in the long term by removing possible protections against future threats.
Enzyme restriction cuts through DNA in a stepped fashion which leaves hung over ends on both sides of the cut which match up with one another. These paired ends are the “sticky ends” which attach to one another once the restriction enzymes are disabled via denaturing. Producing these sticky ends allows the insertion of new DNA segments which have been cut by the same restriction enzyme and therefore the same sticky ends as on the original sequence. Because their sticky ends match, the new DNA and the old DNA can recombine into full strands of DNA.
The discovery of DNA ligase was important, because creating recombinant DNA relies on splicing fragments of DNA together.
Selectable markers genes - such as antibiotic resistance genes - are important because not every cell exposed to the recombinant DNA will become a transgenic cell. Having the selectable marker gene creates an easy way to separate (or kill off) the cells that were not transformed.
aRNA and siRNA are both tools used to limit the expression of mRNA. aRNA is single stranded and prevents transcription by binding to and deforming a complementary strand of mRNA. siRNA is double stranded, and prevents transcription by unwinding and binding to complementary mRNA, which is then fragmented and rendered un-transcriptable.
The first step would be creating a "library" of sorts where different genetic mutations that lead to vulnerabilities can be catalogued by the DNA that causes them. The genes in this library could then be spread on a DNA microarray slide, with thousands of copies of each gene in each well. Then, crop cDNA would be placed in every well. Putting the slide under flourescent light would indicate which strands of defective DNA matched crop cDNA, and would indicate possible vulnerabilities.
Because the process of transformation is inefficient, most cells which are exposed to recombinant DNA are not transformed.  In order to identify the transgenic cells, selectable marker genes can be inserted along with the recombinant DNA molecule.  These genes allow for the growth of only the cells which contain the inserted sequence.  For example, antibiotic resistance genes are used as selectable markers. When exposed to  an antibiotic, cells that do not contain the antibiotic resistant gene will be killed off, and only the transgenic cells will be able to grow.  
Expression vectors include sequences of DNA which maximize the expression of transgenes in host cells   In the case of eukaryotic genes inserted into a bacterial host, expression vectors include a bacterial promoter, signal for transcription termination, and a ribosome binding sequence. If the expression vector were not present, very little of a eukaryotic gene product inserted into a prokaryotic cell would be produced. Expression vectors can also include promoters which specify the stimulation or location that will induce expression.
First of all, yeasts share most characteristics of other eukaryotes (besides those involved in multicellularity). Because they share characteristics, they make for good general hosts.  Yeast is also good because of its small genome size, how easy it is to grow in the lab, and because yeast’s cell division is a very rapid process. 
A cDNA library is a collection of cDNAs from a specific tissue at a specific time in the organism’s life cycle.  cDNA, or complementary DNA is complementary base pairings of mRNA, which has been isolated from the tissue.  The cDNA captures the transcription pattern of the cell, which cannot be captured by the mRNA because the mRNA doesn’t last long in the cytoplasm.  cDNA libraries can be used to compare gene expression in different tissues  at specific stages of development. 
A virus is a more effective vector when the new DNA is very long, for example the sequence found in eukaryotic cells. Viruses are also able to infect cells by themselves, whereas plasmids need to be altered to do so.
DNA manipulation offers several advantages including: it is more precise and predictable, any gene can be used which expands the possibilities for new traits, it is much faster than traditional methods.
DNA manipulation in agricultural biology enables us to create plants that make their own insecticides, herbicide-resistant plants, and nutritionally enhanced plants, all of which can improve crop yield or value to humans (or both). However, concerns have been raised about the effects on humans of eating genetically modified foods and about the potential for negative environmental effects of the proliferation of genetically modified organisms. In general, I agree with the assessment that it is wise to proceed with caution. (This is, however, a personal value-judgment, and it is perfectly reasonable to less cautiously support or to condemn DNA manipulation in agricultural biology.)
Prokaryotes are easily grown and manipulated. They are also well understood, especially for specific types of bacteria. They contain plasmids, which can be used to carry recombinant DNA into a cell. However, it is also useful for scientists to explore gene function in multicellular organisms, which is only possible with eukaryotes. Similarly, for plants and animals to be manipulated to produce new phenotypes, we have to be able to insert genes into eukaryotes. Transcription and translation are also somewhat different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, so studies of those processes in eukaryotes depend upon eukaryotic gene insertion.
All plant cells are totipotent, i.e. they can grow and differentiate into any cell type given the proper signaling factors. Thus, even if only a small piece of tissue is transfected, an entirely new organism can be grown with the new genome in all of its cells, even germ cells. Taking a section of the plant and growing it will produce a genetic clone of the original. In order to genetically modify animals, the egg must be modified and implanted. Not only is it difficult to predict whether the egg itself will survive, gene expression can often only be confirmed after the animal's birth. Furthermore, the organism's offspring may not necessarily express the transfected gene.
While recombinant clotting factors can be synthesized fairly easily from organic sources, they generally much more expensive than that which is derived from serum. However, the latter carries the risk of carrying blood-borne infections, particularly in developing countries. Furthermore, the injections must be carried on indefinitely. While, gene therapy may theoretically offer a permanent management solution to the disease, it is uncertain about the long-term viability of the transfected cells.
